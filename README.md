# Twin Peaks

Two themes for [Zed](https://zed.dev) inspired by Twin Peaks.

## Great Northern Hotel Version

A warm, light theme. Think Douglas firs, Packard Sawmill, and a damn fine cup of coffee.

## One Eyed Jacks Version

A dark theme. You've never heard of it? It's a place up north. Candlelit velvet, dark wood, cigarette smoke.
